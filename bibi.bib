We show that the unification of a linear higher-order pattern s with an arbitrary second-order term that shares no variables with s is decidable and finitary. A few extensions of this unification problem are still decidable\: unifying two second-order terms, where one term is linear, is undecidable if the terms contain bound variables but decidable if they don't. },

  abstract = {A wide range of computer programs, including compilers
                 and theorem provers, manipulate data structures that
                 involve names and binding. However, the design of
                 programming idioms which allow performing these
                 manipulations in a safe and natural style has, to a
                 large extent, remained elusive.\par In this paper, we
                 present a novel approach to the problem. Our proposal
                 can be viewed either as a programming language design
                 or as a library: in fact, it is currently implemented
                 within Agda. It provides a safe and expressive means of
                 programming with names and binders. It is abstract
                 enough to support multiple concrete implementations: we
                 present one in nominal style and one in de Bruijn
                 style. We use logical relations to prove that
                 ``well-typed programs do not mix names with different
                 scope''. We exhibit an adequate encoding of Pitts-style
                 nominal terms into our system.}

                  which uses Taylor's PARMA scheme rather than the
                  standard WAM representation. This allows HAL to
                  generate more efficient Mercury code. Unfortunately,
                  PARMA's variable representation requires value trailing
                  with a trail stack consumption about twice as large as
                  for the WAM. We present a trailing analysis aimed at
                  determining which Herbrand variables do not need to be
                  trailed. The accuracy of the analysis comes from HAL's
                  semi-optional determinism and mode declarations. The
                  analysis has been partially integrated in the HAL
                  compiler and benchmark programs show good speed-up.",

      ABSTRACT={The path-indexing method for indexing first-order predicate calculus
         terms is a refinement of the standard coordinate-indexing method. Path indexing
         offers much faster retrieval at a modest cost in space. Path indexing is compared
         with discrimination-net and codeword indexing. While discrimination-net indexing
         may often be the preferred method for maximum speed, path indexing is an effective
         alternative if discrimination-net indexing requires too much space or in certain
         cases in which discrimination-net indexing performs particularly poorly.}

. A program in a functional language such as Haskell or Miranda consists of equations which are both computation rule\
s and a basis for simple algebraic reasoning about the functions and data structures they define. The existing model \
of functional programming, although elegant and powerful, is compromised to a greater extent than is commonly recogni\
sed by the presence of partial functions. We consider a simple discipline of total functional programming designed to\
 exclude the possibility of non-termination. Among other things this requires a type distinction between data, which \
is finite, and codata, which is potentially infinite.",

abstract = {{
The mechanism for declaring datatypes to model data structures in
programming languages such as Standard ML and Haskell can offer both
convenience in programming and clarity in code.  With the introduction of
dependent datatypes in DML, the programmer can model data structures with
more accuracy, thus capturing more program invariants.  In this paper, we
study some practical aspects of dependent datatypes that affect both
type-checking and compiling pattern matching.  The results, which have
already been tested, demonstrate that dependent datatype can not only offer
various programming benefits but also lead to performance gains, yielding a
concrete case where safer programs run faster.

The framework Pure Type System (PTS) offers a simple and general
approach to designing and formalizing type systems. However, in the
presence of dependent types, there often exist some acute problems that
make it difficult for PTS to accommodate many common realistic
programming features such as general recursion, recursive types, effects
(e.g., exceptions, references, input/output), etc. In this paper, we
propose a new framework Applied Type System (ATS) to allow for designing
and formalizing type systems that can readily support common realistic
programming features. The key salient feature of ATS lies in a complete
separation between statics, in which types are formed and reasoned about,
and dynamics, in which programs are constructed and evaluated. With this
separation, it is no longer possible for a program to occur in a type as is
otherwise allowed in PTS.  We present not only a formal development of
ATS but also mention some examples in support of using ATS as a
framework to form type systems for practical programming.

  ABSTRACT = {
Generalized algebraic data types (GADTs), sometimes known as ``guarded recursive data types'' or
``first-class phantom types'', are a simple but powerful generalization of the
data types of Haskell and ML.  Recent works have given compelling examples of the utility of
GADTs, although type inference is known to be difficult.
Our contribution is to show how to exploit programmer-supplied type annotations
to make the type inference task almost embarrassingly easy.
Our main technical innovation is \emph{wobbly types},
which express in a declarative way the uncertainty caused by the
incremental nature of typical type-inference algorithms.

  abstract =     {We motivate the design of a statically typed assembly
                  language (TAL) and present a type-preserving translation from
                  System F to TAL. The TAL we present is based on a
                  conventional RISC assembly language, but its static type
                  system provides support for enforcing high-level language
                  abstractions, such as closures, tuples, and objects, as well
                  as user-defined abstract data types. The type system ensures
                  that well-typed programs cannot violate these
                  abstractions. In addition, the typing constructs place almost
                  no restrictions on low-level optimizations such as register
                  allocation, instruction selection, or instruction
                  scheduling. Our translation to TAL is specified as a sequence
                  of type-preserving transformations, including CPS and closure
                  conversion phases; type-correct source programs are mapped to
                  type-correct assembly language. A key contribution is an
                  approach to polymorphic closure conversion that is
                  considerably simpler than previous work. The compiler and
                  typed assembly language provide a fully automatic way to
                  produce proof carrying code, suitable for use in systems
                  where untrusted and potentially malicious code must be

                  is safe to execute a program supplied (possibly in binary
                  form) by an untrusted source. For this to be possible, the
                  untrusted code producer must supply with the code a safety
                  proof that attests to the code's adherence to a previously
                  defined safety policy.  The host can then easily and quickly
                  validate the proof without using cryptography and without
                  consulting any external agents.
                  In order to gain preliminary experience with PCC, we have
                  performed several case studies.  We show in this paper how
                  proof-carrying code might be used to develop safe
                  assembly-language extensions of ML programs. In the context
                  of this case study, we present and prove the adequacy of
                  concrete representations for the safety policy, the safety
                  proofs, and the proof validation.  Finally, we briefly
                  discuss how we use proof-carrying code to develop network
                  packet filters that are faster than similar filters developed
                  using other techniques and are formally guaranteed to be safe

                  Existing compilers that generate certified code have
                  focused on simple memory and control-flow safety rather
                  than more advanced properties. In this paper, we present
                  a general framework for explicitly representing complex
                  propositions and proofs in typed intermediate and assembly
                  languages.  The new framework allows us to reason about
                  certified programs that involve effects while still
                  maintaining decidable typechecking.  We show how to
                  integrate an entire proof system (the calculus of
                  inductive constructions) into a compiler intermediate
                  language and how the intermediate language can undergo
                  complex transformations (CPS and closure conversion) while
                  preserving proofs represented in the type system. Our work
                  provides a foundation for the process of automatically
                  generating certified binaries in a type-theoretic
                  framework.}

of semantic preservation) of CompCert, a compiler from Clight (a
large subset of the C programming language) to PowerPC assembly code,
using the Coq proof assistant both for programming the compiler and
for proving its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in
the context of critical software and its formal verification: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.}
